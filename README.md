# Web Penetration Testing Report

## Executive Summary

### Purpose of the Test

The purpose of this penetration test was to identify and exploit vulnerabilities in the OWASP Juice Shop application. The goal was to simulate potential attack scenarios, understand their impacts, and recommend remediations to enhance the application's security.

Key Findings

Critical Vulnerabilities Identified:

i. Vulnerable to enumeration attacks.

ii. Susceptible to brute-force attacks due to the absence of rate-limiting.

iii. Reflective XSS vulnerabilities in the product search feature.

iv. SQL injection vulnerabilities in application forms.

Impact:

These vulnerabilities can lead to unauthorized administrative access, data theft, and exploitation of the application.

Summary of Recommendations

Implement rate-limiting and CAPTCHA mechanisms.

Validate and sanitize user inputs to prevent XSS and SQL injection attacks.

Restrict access to sensitive paths and randomize admin URLs.
